# Contributing guide 

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ First of all â€” thank you for considering contributing to this project. Every bit of help is appreciated and valued.

This guide is here to explain how contributions work and to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to collaboration and licensing.

## How to contribute

Whether you're fixing a typo, improving documentation, or adding a feature â€” you're welcome here. To contribute, simply:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Open a pull request

## Licensing of contributions

This project is released under the **AGPL-3.0** license, which ensures that the software remains open and available to everyone under strong copyleft terms.

However, to keep things flexible for future development and potential use cases (including things like long-term sustainability, hosted versions, or partnerships), all contributions are accepted under the **MIT license**.

This means:
- The project **remains AGPL-3.0** for everyone using it.
- As a contributor, you agree to license your contribution under MIT license.

This setup helps to maintain the project over the long term and avoids complicated relicensing efforts down the road. By submitting a pull request, you confirm that you voluntarily license your contribution under the MIT License for the benefit of the projectâ€™s future development.

## Other ways to support the project

Even if you're not contributing code, there are still valuable ways to get involved:

- **Open an issue** with feedback, suggestions, or bug reports â€” your input helps improve the project for everyone.
- **Support the project** through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/matt765) to help keep development active.

Every form of support means a lot and helps keep this project alive and growing. 

## A Note of Thanks

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute. Your effort, no matter how small it may seem, helps make this project better for everyone.

Happy coding!
